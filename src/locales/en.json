      "introduce": "Taipei Game Developers Forum (TGDF) is going strong into its 6th year, and currently the biggest professional conference focusing on game development in Taiwan, attracting around one thousand domestic and overseas attendees last year. In the past years, we invited influential and experienced speakers such as Keiji Inafune, Neil McFarland, Rami Ismail, Kelly Wallick, Alex Schwartz and more to talk about a wide variety of topics. In last year’s TGDF, we continued our VR showcases with HTC, and opened up TGDF Indie Space, a showcase area dedicated to indie developers in collaboration with Indie MEGABOOTH, and finally a series of business matchmaking sessions. All in all, we are trying our best to keep growing TGDF into an all-encompassing game development event in Taiwan.",
