In the past years, we invited influential and experienced speakers such as Keiji Inafune, Neil McFarland, Rami Ismail, Kelly Wallick, Alex Schwartz and more to talk about a wide variety of topics. In last year’s TGDF, we continued our VR showcases with HTC, and opened up TGDF Indie Space, a showcase area dedicated to indie developers in collaboration with Indie MEGABOOTH, and finally a series of business matchmaking sessions. All in all, we are trying our best to keep growing TGDF into an all-encompassing game development event in Taiwan.",\n\t\t\t"location": "Taipei New Horizon Building 6F",\n\t\t\t"call_for_paper": "Call For Paper",\n\t\t\t"date": "June 30th – July 1st, 2017"\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\t"english": "English",\n\t"chinese": "繁體中文"\n};\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./src/locales/en.json\n// module id = ./node_modules/json-loader/index.js!./src/locales/en.json\n// module chunks = 1\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/locales/en.json?./~/json-loader')}});
